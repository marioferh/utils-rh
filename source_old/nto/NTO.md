# NTO

NTO its a cluster node operator, thus, is installed with ocp.

To generate custom PAO inside NTO just modify PAO and create a new image with build.sh script.

To test custom NTO image:

- launch build.sh
- Select a operator manifest
- Change source of container image to install:

  ```console
    containers:
      - name: cluster-node-tuning-operator
        image: quay.io/user/cluster-node-tuning-operator:4.12_hints_v1
  ```

- Launch scale: oc scale deploy/cluster-version-operator --replicas=0 -n openshift-cluster-version
- Apply manifest: oc apply -f manifest/

Now custom NTO image is installed, continue with PAO deployment.
